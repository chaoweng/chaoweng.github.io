I'm Chaowen Guan, an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at University of Cincinnati starting Jan 2024. Before that, I received my PhD in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2020. Now I'm postdoctoral Scholar in the [CS Theory Group](https://theory.cse.psu.edu/) at the Pennsylvania State University.

Currently, my research interests are about quantum algorithms and its applications to real-life problems, such as chemistry, material science, etc.

Iâ€™m looking for two CS PhD students to join my group at UC. Both positions will be fully funded. More information can be found in [CS PhD program website](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/computer-science/degrees-programs/computer-science-engineering-phd.html)
