postdoc at Penn State. working with Prof Sean Hallgren.

I'm Chaowen Guan, an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at University of Cincinnati starting Jan 2024. Before that, I received my PhD in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2020. Now I'm postdoctoral Scholar in the [CS Theory Group](https://theory.cse.psu.edu/) at the Pennsylvania State University.

Currently, my research interests are about quantum algorithms and its applications to real-life problems, such as chemistry, material science, etc.

I’m looking for two CS PhD students to join my group at UC. Both positions will be fully funded. More information can be found in [CS PhD program website](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/computer-science/degrees-programs/computer-science-engineering-phd.html)
